                            Regulation in a Virtual Healing Space</h2>
                        <p class="research-card-text">
                            With increasing social pressure, the youth population in colleges and universities
                            generally faces increasingly severe negative emotional problems, which not only affect
                            academic performance but also significantly reduce the quality of daily life. In response
                            to this challenge, numerous educational institutions have established psychological
                            healing rooms to provide emotional support and stress management services.
                            However, existing psychological healing spaces often fail to achieve the expected
                            healing effects and affect student engagement due to a lack of sufficient privacy
                            and interactivity. To address this issue, this study proposes a virtual psychological
                            healing space design based on the audiovisual fusion effect, aiming to improve
                            students’ emotional regulation and mental health management by enhancing privacy
                            and interactivity. The design prototype incorporates four natural environments: water
                            and sky, woodland and sky, grassland and sky, and elemental uniform distribution
                            environments. Each environment is paired with customized Lofi music to enhance the
                            healing effect through a multi-sensory experience. Additionally, by utilizing Unreal
                            Engine’s dynamic sky and weather simulation system for natural light, real-time
                            transitions between four lighting environments (early morning, midday, dusk, and
                            night) were achieved in virtual reality to explore the specific effects of light intensity
                            on emotion regulation. This study surveyed 30 college student participants to collect
                            the subjective effects of environmental lighting on emotions in a virtual healing space
                            through semi-structured interviews. This study demonstrates that varying lighting
                            conditions have a significant impact on participants’ emotional states. It underscores
                            the critical necessity of customizing lighting to accommodate the specific needs of
                            users in the design of virtual healing spaces, thereby minimizing the influence of
                            inter-individual differences on therapeutic outcomes. The results of this study provide
                            an empirical basis for designing virtual healing spaces and are expected to offer
                            a theoretical reference and practical basis for implementing personalized healing
                            strategies in virtual environments

                            Integrating NSGA-II and Simulated Annealing</h2>
                        <p class="research-card-text">
                            Traditional user interface layout design heavily relies on designers' subjective judgment
                            and lacks effective quantitative assessment methods. This study aims to overcome this
                            shortcoming. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) system
                            designed for the low-fidelity prototyping phase to enable faster production of high-quality
                            interface layouts. A hybrid algorithm (SNSGA-II) is designed in the system, which combines
                            the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the simulated annealing (SA)
                            algorithm, along with a scoring system including both aesthetics and usability. During the
                            high-temperature phase, the SA algorithm is responsible for global exploration, while the
                            genetic algorithm is introduced during the low-temperature phase for refined optimization,
                            combined with an improved sigmoid function to dynamically balance the weights of each
                            evaluation dimension. The experimental results show that this system achieved significant
                            optimization effects across three UI design tasks with varying complexity levels. Compared
                            with traditional NSGA-II algorithm, the SNSGA-II algorithm demonstrated approximately 50%
                            improvement in convergence speed. Evaluation by 20 professional UI designers showed that
                            system-optimized designs exhibited consistent improvements across all complexity levels:
                            overall design quality enhanced by 3.0%, 6.7%, and 6.5% for simple, moderate, and complex
                            tasks respectively; aesthetic scores correspondingly increased by 5.6%, 5.7%, and 5.2%;
                            learnability indicators improved by 4.1%, 6.1%, and 7.2% respectively. This study confirmed
                            the effectiveness of this approach in balancing aesthetics and usability, demonstrating its
                            algorithmic performance and practical optimization potential.

                            Study Using VR and Space Syntax</h2>
                        <p class="research-card-text">
                            In recent years, natural disasters and armed conflicts have occurred with increasing
                            frequency, severely disrupting everyday life. These events produce large numbers of
                            displaced refugees, creating significant challenges for the planning and design of
                            post-disaster temporary settlements. One crucial issue is how to use spatial layout to
                            facilitate efficient movement and resource acquisition within these settlements. This study
                            identifies four prototypical spatial configurations commonly found in temporary
                            settlements—fishbone, organic growth, grid, and bagua—and constructs corresponding 3D
                            virtual environments. To simulate the navigation behaviors of disaster victims seeking
                            supplies and gathering within settlements, 36 university students were recruited to perform
                            navigation tasks in VR across the four layouts. Their task completion time and walking
                            trajectories were recorded.

                            <br><br>
                            Using space syntax analysis, we quantified the intelligibility of each layout and extracted
                            three types of optimal paths between task nodes: the shortest metric path, the fewest-turns
                            path, and the minimum-angle-change path. This study focuses on two core questions:
                            <br>
                            (1) Whether differences in spatial intelligibility across layouts significantly affect
                            navigation efficiency (i.e., reaction time).
                            <br>
                            (2) How strongly each of the three optimal path types influences participants’ route
                            choices.

                            <br><br>
                            Statistical results show that settlements with higher spatial intelligibility yield
                            significantly shorter reaction times, while gender and prior spatial-training experience
                            have no significant effect. Overlap analysis between participants’ actual trajectories and
                            the three optimal path types revealed the following ranking (from highest to lowest
                            similarity): shortest metric path, minimum-angle-change path, and fewest-turns path.

                            <br><br>
                            Through the combined use of space syntax and VR-based comparative experiments, this study
                            reveals the mechanisms by which settlement layout shapes spatial navigation behavior in
                            post-disaster contexts, providing valuable guidance for the future planning and design of
                            temporary disaster relief settlements.

                            System for ACL Postoperative Knee Rehabilitation</h2>
                        <p class="research-card-text">
                            Postoperative rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction remains
                            limited by insufficient real time feedback, inconsistent adherence, and the absence of
                            individualized sensor driven evaluation. Current home based rehabilitation practices rarely
                            capture the neuromechanical factors that underlie functional recovery, including
                            proprioceptive deficits, joint loading asymmetries, and altered movement strategies. This
                            research proposes the development of an immersive rehabilitation framework that integrates
                            inertial measurement unit based motion capture with virtual reality environments to
                            investigate how real time digital representations of movement can enhance sensorimotor
                            learning. By combining multi sensor IMU data with a VR based digital twin of lower limb
                            motion, the system will provide multimodal biofeedback that adapts to the user’s performance
                            in real time. The project aims to examine how immersive feedback influences proprioceptive
                            recalibration, movement symmetry, and patient motivation, and to develop computational
                            models capable of characterizing individual recovery trajectories. The expected contribution
                            is a validated sensor driven rehabilitation paradigm that advances theoretical understanding
                            of motor learning in postoperative populations while informing the design of next generation
                            interactive rehabilitation technologies.

                            Conventional, Automatic, and Proactive AI Guidance in a VR Kitchen Task</h2>
                        <p class="research-card-text">
                            This study investigates how three AI assistance strategies—Conventional (user-initiated),
                            Automatic (time-based), and Proactive (behavior-triggered)—shape wayfinding performance and
                            user experience in a VR kitchen task. Using behavioral logs, trajectories, and event data
                            from three participants across all conditions, we observe consistent patterns: the
                            Conventional assistant leads to prolonged hesitation and delayed help-seeking; the Automatic
                            assistant reduces disorientation but disrupts natural exploration through frequent,
                            time-driven prompts; and the Proactive assistant intervenes only when behavioral cues
                            indicate genuine confusion, providing timely support without interrupting ongoing activity.
                            These results offer preliminary evidence that Proactive assistance achieves the best balance
                            between efficiency and experiential quality—improving navigation performance while
                            preserving user agency and reducing cognitive load. We discuss design implications for
                            embodied AI guidance, including respecting bodily cues, aligning intervention timing with
                            user rhythms, and avoiding over-automation in XR navigation systems.
